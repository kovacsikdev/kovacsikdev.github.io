      It is as bare bones as I could make it.
      Notice how all of the interactions are done without any JavaScript?
      The Skills toggle button, accordions, and project screenshot scroll snapping

        <p>
          Fullstack Developer with over 7 years of experience. I mainly focus on
          Frontend development as a React Developer using TypeScript. I enjoy
          building tools and apps. I am always learning new things and growing
          as a developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I work with multiple teams in multiple departments including QA
          testers, designers, product owners, business, etc. I mentor and train
          new new hires and junior developers.

              <p>
                Currently working for Kitestring contracted out to Walmart
                building a next gen Point of Sale system for associates in
                Canada.
              </p>
              <p>
                Utilizing React and Redux, we are building a UI application to
                make it easy for associates to ring up customers. The app is
                currently being used on many registers and we are continuously
                adding more features and fixing bugs.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are simplifying the complex features a Point of Sale system
                can offer. I build complex features by integrating designs, API
                endpoints (some with GET requests, some with POST requests with
                payloads), user interaction flows, and handling edge cases.
              </p>
              <p>
                I focus mainly on the Frontend using React, Redux, and
                TypeScript. I help implement Backend API communication and the
                communication between the application and the physical devices
                used by associates such as the cash drawer, hand scanners, and
                the pin pad.
              </p>
              <p>
                I work with multiple teams including Frontend developers,
                Backend developers, Product Owners, Designers, QA testers,
                Payment systems, Business, and sometimes Walmart Associates
                directly.
              </p>
              <p>
                I write up detailed documentation on the flows and other
                developer notes (including screenshots) for both business and
                developers in Confluence.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have trained, on-boarded and mentored multiple developers
                including junior developers.

                Worked as a Web Developer for a car rental company developing
                widgets that can be easily integrating into existing websites
                for customers. Our biggest customers were airlines. The widget
                is seen and interacted with by thousands of people world wide,
                but mostly in Europe. As it is world wide, the widget supports
                over 50 languages and the styling is configurable according to
                the customer's preference or company branding.

                I developed custom libraries and components in a React JS
                monorepo. I wrote 100% code coverage unit tests via Jest. I used
                Git and Jenkins pipeline for continuous development and
                integration. I documented processes and instructions in
                Confluence and Jira.
